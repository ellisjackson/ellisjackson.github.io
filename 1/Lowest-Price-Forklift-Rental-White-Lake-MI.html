If you're a more adventurous driver that likes to go off-road, a lifted truck is a great way to enable you to challenge yourself to take on more difficult terrain.</p>
<p>When standard pallet sizes launched in 1930, forklifts became even more useful.

OSHA standards require that the employer ensure that forklift operator is competent to operate the forklift he or she is assigned to use.</p>
