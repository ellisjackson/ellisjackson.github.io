<p>We have access to many brands, so we will have a Forklift solution that fits your requirements. Available for a majority of popular trucks including the 1500 Silverado and the Ram 2500, Fabtech makes sure your truck gets lifted the right way without taking any shortcuts.

<p>The trucks make light work of heavy loads, while the scales impress with their outstanding precision. The correct capacity will narrow your used forklift for sale search down to a couple of models. Smaller in size when compared to pneumatic tire forklift of equal capacity. This is used, for example, when the tires on one side of the forklift are up on a mound of dirt and the tires on the other side are down in a rut.</p>

<p>If your service crew is already busy with the rest of your equipment, don't load them up with even more equipment to maintain.

If you're working outdoors, a gas forklift may make sense, but the introduction of the electric forklift has fundamentally changed warehouse usage.</p>
<p>Gap guards are used to fill in this area and make these lifted trucks look better. Our reach truck training courses are ideal as conversion training for operators already experienced and skilled in using typical counterbalance fork lifts, with a range of the essential skills and knowledge crossing over between the two.
