On new forklifts we offer up to 72 months of either a $1 buyout or a True FMV lease option.

<p>There is a large range of forklifts available, and each one is designed to be used for specific jobs. We are one of the distinguished hand pallet truck manufacturers in Bangalore. A fatigued forklift operator is one of the most dangerous things to have on a jobsite.
