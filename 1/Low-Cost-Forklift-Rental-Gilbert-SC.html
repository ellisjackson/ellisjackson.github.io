<p>Looking to rent material handling equipment in Phoenix? Cargo type - You need to consider factors like the packaging of your cargo, the type of pallets used, and whether or not the load has a unique shape. Plus, their 8,000+ rental yards means there's probably one near you already.

<p>Do not overload a lift truck. The most common type of forklift has a heavy counterweight over the rear tires to balance the load.
