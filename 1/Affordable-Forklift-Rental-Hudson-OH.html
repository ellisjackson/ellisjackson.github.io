<p>The answers are also important for you to choose the correct forklift attachments to do the job at hand. Whether your team needs forklifts every day or on rare occasion, renting forklifts may be the best fiscal option.

If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
