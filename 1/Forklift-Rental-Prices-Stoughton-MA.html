<p>The cost of renting a bucket truck will depend on the truck you're driving, the company, the working height, the geographical location and time you need it.

To get around this issue, the counterbalanced stacker has a longer chassis to increase leverage. Forklifts are responsible for only 1% of all warehouse or factory accidents. Our experienced service technicians are ready and able to repair all makes and models of forklifts.</p>
