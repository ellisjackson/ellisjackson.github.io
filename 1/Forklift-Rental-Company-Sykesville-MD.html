The W-series also includes five other versatile pallet trucks with a load capacity up to 2.5 tonnes, making them suitable for all manner of material handling, including horizontal transportation and order picking.</p>
<p>This is an important distinction because in order to install a lift kit, the truck's body and frame must be separate. We have seen that business owners who use a hand pallet truck give much productivity per day.
