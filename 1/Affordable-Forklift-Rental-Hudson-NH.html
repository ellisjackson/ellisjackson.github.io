For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical or at full rearward till, whichever is less stable.</p>

If your employer deems this certification to be sufficient enough to operate the forklift safely and properly, they will grant you a license. The top supplying country or region is China, which supply 100% of all terrain forklifts respectively.</p>
