<p>In digging around facts about a forklift rental company, some things you might consider are the company's service level agreements, the age and condition of their forklifts available for rent, as well as the questions they ask to rental enquiries.

The most basic piece of material handling equipment is the hand pallet truck.

The only difference is a slightly heavier counterweight that gives the extra 500 lb. capacity to the truck.</p>
<p>How to choose the right forklift for your business. The spacious cab and adjustable controls offer the operator great comfort, even at height.
