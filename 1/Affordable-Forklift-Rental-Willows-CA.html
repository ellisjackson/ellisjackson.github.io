<p>Sfikas said all car manufacturers want to know the people who are installing the kits and ensure they are doing so without tampering with the integrity of the vehicle.

Hand-pallet trucks (aka pump trucks) are non-powered tools used to move palletised loads; typically up to 5500 lbs.</p>
<p>And because body lift kits don't significantly modify the entire suspension, you're left with a high center of gravity and poor ways of dealing with death wobble.
