A conveyor, overhead hoist, or equivalent material handling equipment shall be provided for handling batteries. Off-road forklifts are suitable for almost any environment (construction sites, docks, forests, etc.), they offer increased mobility and excellent results in areas where the terrain is rough.

That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
