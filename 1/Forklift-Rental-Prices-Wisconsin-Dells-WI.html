<p>A lifted truck also has a higher resale value because of how valuable these trucks are. We have used lifted trucks in stock from time-to-time, but we cannot guarantee availability on pre-owned models due to frequent changes in our inventory. As a result, customers should contact our team with questions about these suspension lift kits. The taller tires get the differential higher off the ground, reducing the risk of damage from obstacles, and all four wheels gain maximum traction due to the lifted suspension.</p>
