<h2>Hand Lift Truck Cortez</h2>

The 44236 Series has two machines, with capacities of 6,000 and 8,000 pounds, offering lift heights up to 34 feet.

Never try to stop a pallet jack with hands or feet, this could cause serious injury, especially with a very heavy load.

<h3>Different Forklift Types Cortez CO</h3>
