Different types of tyres are available for forklifts. According to a TICO representative, the materials handling equipment market as a whole continued to expand globally due mainly to increases in unit sales in Europe and North America as well as a recovery in China, although unit sales in Japan were on par with the previous fiscal year.</p>

Our Rental Purchase Option (RPO) provides customers with an opportunity to acquire equipment by building equity over the rental period. When properly operated and maintained, a forklift is an invaluable piece of equipment.</p>
<p>CENTER CONTROL: The operator control position is located near the center of the truck. Available for trucks and SUVs with as much as 12 inches of lift, Superlift is the brand to choose when replacing shocks trucks equipped with the tallest lift kits.

Widely used in construction for loads from 3,000 - 15,000lbs. Featuring an air spring with superior ride quality, this unit softens typical loaded ride conditions by transferring load from the vehicle's leaf spring to the Hellwig Air Spring.</p>
<p>The load limit is shown on the data plate of the lift truck. Monster street truck drivers are at the distinct disadvantage in close quarters when maneuvering, such as in stop-and-go driving, city traffic, and even parking. Consideration should be given to reducing tilt speeds on trucks with extra high lift. Reach forklifts can operate in aisles as narrow as 2.4 meters, as opposed to the counterbalance's minimum requirement of 3.7 meters.</p>
