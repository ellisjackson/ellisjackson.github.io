<h2>Reach Lift Truck Bay Shore</h2>
<p>The U.S. Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) has guidelines in place to help forklift operators, pallet jack drivers, and other industrial powered truck workers be aware of their machine's ability to lift, maneuver, and store cargo. When it's done right, you can expect a lifted Jeep to have better pulling power, a greater capacity to off-road because of its increased clearance, and the ability to use a much larger set of off-road tires.</p>
<p>You can set them up with work-saver forks (roughly about 9” wide), and they lift pallets some few inches from the ground. Never try to stop a pallet jack with hands or feet, this could cause serious injury, especially with a very heavy load. There are some specialty trucks that are used in specific industries or in certain settings, such as a sideloader that picks up and carries pallets to the side of the vehicle instead of in the front.</p>
