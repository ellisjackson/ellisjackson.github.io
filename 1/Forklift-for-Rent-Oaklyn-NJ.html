Ask your Raymond Handling Concepts Sales Rep about new, used or rental availability of order pickers.</p>

The air springs will provide load support for your truck and will automatically inflate or deflate with air pressure based on the load you are attempting to carry.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, an empty truck with the forks elevated 12 inches from the test platform, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck in standing is tilted to the slope specified in Graph E.

Ensure loads are stacked evenly on the forks before moving the pallet jack.</p>
<p>The hand pallet or lift truck has wheels located under the fork and uses a hydraulic jack for lifting and moving the pallets. When you need to rent, rent the best - from the only one stop rental fleet in India.
