<p>And Part B. Trucks should be recognized as being built in accord with paragraphs 7 through 143 of UL Standards for Safety 558, Second Edition, September 1961 Internal Combustion Engine-Powered Industrial Trucks” and paragraphs 7 through 130 and 132 through 187 of UL Standards for Safety 583, Fourth Edition, November 1956, Revised September 1960 Power-Operated Industrial Trucks.” Trucks and areas of use should be marked in accordance with NFPA Standard No. 505 — 1968, Section 800.</p>
<p>If it is only to be used for a handful of hours each week, you can safely settle for a used forklift that is ten to twelve years old, because you are likely to get another seven or eight years of useful service out of it. Buyers can make the mistake of only opting for more recent models of used fork trucks, but far more important than this is the number of operating hours and the overall condition of the second hand truck for sale.</p>
<p>First, we assembled 105 different kinds of forklifts from all walks of industrial life. Forklifts are also organized based on their classification. We highly recommend that you consult with us on which unit is best suited to your needs and that you discuss the best forklift rentals with our team to ensure that you streamline material handling processes within your business and keep related costs low at the same time.</p>
