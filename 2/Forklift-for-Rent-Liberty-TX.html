Counterbalance forklifts are very versatile and are available in three or four wheeled models, have two forks protruding from the front of the machine, and have a counterbalance weight in the back of the truck to ensure loads don't create an imbalance.</p>
<p>It is impractical to build a guard of sufficient strength to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load since such a guard would constitute a safety hazard because its structure would be so large that it might interfere with good visibility, and would weigh so much that it might make the truck top-heavy and unstable. These Class 5 forklifts, sometimes called Yard Trucks,” are larger when compared to a Cushion tire unit of equal capacity and offer a softer ride.</p>
