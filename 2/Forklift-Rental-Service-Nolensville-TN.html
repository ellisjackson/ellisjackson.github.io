<p>We ensure that our customers can find the right forklift for the right job.

<p>Whether you are trying to learn more about these wonderful machines or perhaps hoping to diversify your fleet, here are the seven different categories of forklifts and a breakdown of what they are used for. Whether the driver will be using the vehicle for rock climbing, regular road travel, racing, or for use in sandy or water-filled areas, will determine the type of tires that need to be put on the truck.</p>
<p>Often, a driver will raise the axle to enable the vehicle to turn easier and not have to drag the lift axle sideways through a turn. The order picker is a type of forklift that is made for fast and efficient stock picking. Short Term Forklift Rentals can help temporary and seasonal requirements when you company has a need for an additional Forklift or a Different size forklift on a short term basis.</p>

<p>Trucks are pushing such boundaries with lift kits these days that it's almost getting ridiculous to see guys actually climb into them. The smaller design and increased maneuverability of narrow aisle forklifts allow them to reach tight areas and readily respond to unexpected hazards effectively. Meanwhile, Crown introduced a new 2-stage TL mast , commonly referred to as a Truckers Mast,‚Äù for its Crown FC 5200 Series counterbalance forklifts and the pneumatic and cushion tire models of the Crown C-5 Series industrial forklifts.</p>
<p>Order picker forklifts are usually powered by electric motors because they don't generate noxious fumes.

Air Lift on-board air compressor systems will let you inflate and deflate your air springs from inside your cab or outside your vehicle.

A lifted truck shows that there's more to a modern pickup than just its performance and tech features.</p>
