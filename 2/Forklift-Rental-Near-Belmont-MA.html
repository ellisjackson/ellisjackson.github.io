<p>Toyota's industrial vehicle and equipment business started in March 1956 with lift truck production and sales in Japan.

<h3>Reach Forklift For Sale Belmont MA</h3>
<p>Considerations include forklift type, capacity, carriage type, and number of hydraulic functions (that power the attachment features). In the past most order picking jobs were carried out on ground level to increase the productivity, while stock was replenished to the bottom layer with reach & fork trucks. A typical lift truck uses two power-operated horizontal prongs (forks) that can be raised and lowered for loading, transporting, and unloading goods, particularly goods stacked on wooden pallets.</p>
<p>This system is a result of the various types of forklift training available. In addition, the use of a powered industrial truck in a location for which that type of powered industrial truck is not designated for use, for example due to a flammable atmosphere, can result in a fire or explosion. This means that Linde reach trucks can maneuver safely and quickly, even in confined spaces and handling conditions in warehouses.</p>
<p>We do extend special rates for longer term rentals. If your truck is lifted, or if you're getting ready to have a lift kit installed, make sure you're aware of all the potential safety and handling implications that are associated with the additional height and hardware. Rough terrain forklifts, as the name implies, are designed to run on rough, unpaved surfaces.</p>
