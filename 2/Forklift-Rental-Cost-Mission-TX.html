<p>The desire to own the biggest, baddest, shiniest forklift fresh off the assembly line is understandable. Keep these statistics in mind while training workers and safely operating forklifts. This additional clearance requires installing larger tires and in order to do that, you need to get everything up off the ground more. Yale Materials Handling Corporation markets a full line of materials handling lift truck products and services, including electric, gas, LP-gas and diesel powered lift trucks; narrow aisle, very narrow aisle and motorized hand trucks.</p>

Crazy lift kits and cab stretching isn't just for light duty trucks. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident, because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck.</p>
