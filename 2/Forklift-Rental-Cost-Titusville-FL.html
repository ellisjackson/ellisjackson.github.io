	<meta name="description" content="Forklift Manufacturing Companies Around Titusville Florida - Floor-stacking does not require the purchase of warehouse racking that takes up valuable warehouse space, making this the preferred method of 3PL's everywhere (much to the chagrin of pallet racking manufacturers and distributors!) The ability to floor-stack a product is based on the stability of the loaded pallet combined with the product's capacity to handle the weight without buckling on itself.">

However, in both cases, these vehicles have to be operated by a person who can either sit or stand while operating the forklift.</p>
