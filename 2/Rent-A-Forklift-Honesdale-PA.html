Each is designed to work within extreme environments, natural landscapes, and the uneven ground often found on construction sites.</p>
<p>Pallet jacks are cheap, small in size, and good for small loads. Purchasing a lifted truck can be somewhat difficult, because these rare vehicles are hard to come by in some locations. They can handle anything from small single pallet loads to 40-foot loaded containers.
