The catch is that you do have to test for various types of lift trucks. Here at Ultimate Rides, we breath eat and sleep lifted 4×4 trucks and jeeps. Hand-pallet trucks (aka pump trucks) are non-powered tools used to move palletised loads; typically up to 5500 lbs.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
