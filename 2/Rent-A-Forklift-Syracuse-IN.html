An alternative to class 3s, tuggers can pull large loads without requiring the equipment to lift it off the ground to do it. This class is used on high traffic sites such as airport landing strips and luggage collection as they are easier to maneuver than a full forklift.</p>

With so many options available to you, the best way to make sure you find lifted trucks that work for what you need is through a knowledgeable and experienced dealer that specializes in these kinds of vehicles.</p>
