This Motorised pallet truck is used in several industries for lifting purposes and due to its long functional life.

Additionally Pengate rentals offer the following advantages: low rates (which include batteries and chargers); rental rates may be expensible for tax purposes; maintenance service by our Raymond Certified Technicians at no added charge; the ability to opt into a rent-to-own program.</p>
<p>There are also variants that features a stand-up forklift, which makes it easier for operators to hop on and off between loads. The user should mark, on the sides of the truck, in letters at least 1½ in. high, the actual vehicle weight, the maximum load and the combined weight of the vehicle and capacity load. The 35 Construction Teletruk counterbalance forklift with telescopic boom is a proven cost saver.</p>
