Because of the nature of their work and the environments in which they operate, using rough terrain forklifts can also pose numerous hazards.</p>

This will determine the kind of forklift needed to be able to maneuver through the space in which the truck is working.</p>
<p>Those who operate powered forklifts must pass classroom training and a driving test before being licensed.

If you've never rented before, you might be surprised at the actual forklift rental cost and how affordable it can be. However, statistics show that companies that own their fleets tend to keep their forklifts longer than financially makes sense.</p>
