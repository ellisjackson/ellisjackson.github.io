<h2>Pallet Truck Lifting Equipment Garden City</h2>
<p>Forklifts can actually be traced back to the late 1800's, but the modern forklift was developed in the 1960s by various companies including the transmission manufacturing company Clark and the hoist company Yale & Towne Manufacturing. This counterbalance (whether it's an actual weight or the forklift batteries found in an electric lift) is what offsets the load in front, accommodating weights from 3,000 to 120,000 lbs depending on the model selected.</p>
<p>In a bizarre incident captured on surveillance cameras, strong winds lifted a truck off the ground and flipped it around on its front wheel before slamming it back on the road. Truck drivers from the Richardson and Garland regions won't believe the lifted trucks and 4x4 conversion trucks on sale right now at Young Chevrolet in Dallas. Forklift trucks need to spend the maximum amount of time hard at work.</p>
