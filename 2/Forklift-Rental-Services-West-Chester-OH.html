This Motorised pallet truck is used in several industries for lifting purposes and due to its long functional life.

<p>While the machine is designed to work on rough terrain, it isn't always set to work on all types of terrain. When you rent a forklift from Gregory Poole Lift Systems, you get the adaptability you need from your forklift fleet, without a huge impact on your bottom line.
