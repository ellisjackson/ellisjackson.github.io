<p>The desire to own the biggest, baddest, shiniest forklift fresh off the assembly line is understandable. Keep these statistics in mind while training workers and safely operating forklifts. This additional clearance requires installing larger tires and in order to do that, you need to get everything up off the ground more.

If alternate capacities are shown for elevations lower than maximum, alternate capacities not shown may be 2 assumed to fall on a straight line between the capacity and the alternate capacities shown for each load center.</p>
