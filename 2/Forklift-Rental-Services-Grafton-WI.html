This counterbalance (whether it's an actual weight or the forklift batteries found in an electric lift) is what offsets the load in front, accommodating weights from 3,000 to 120,000 lbs depending on the model selected.</p>

Like how its name says, the side loader forklift can drive up alongside pallet racks or other industrial shelving and can unload without having to turn.
