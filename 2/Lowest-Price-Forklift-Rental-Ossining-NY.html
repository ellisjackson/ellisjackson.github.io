I am not an expert on lift kits, but based on my personal observation, they offer sizes like "six inches," or "eight inches," or "tall enough to provide storm shelter for a herd of Black Rhinoceros." That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
<p>A forklift goes by many names, people tend to refer to it as many different things such as a forklift truck, lift truck, fork truck, forklift.
