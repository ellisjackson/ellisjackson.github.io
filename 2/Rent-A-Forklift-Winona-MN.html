<p>Raymond 4000 Series sit down forklifts provide the visibility needed to maximize operator confidence, and minimize damage to racks, products, and facilities. It's the grandchild of the C5000 series, one of the most beloved forklifts ever made. Not all forklifts work the same, and many come equipped with different features. These forklifts can drive under 8 foot passages, and come in two-wheel, four-wheel, and four-wheel crab steering (all wheels are able to turn).</p>
<p>And because body lift kits don't significantly modify the entire suspension, you're left with a high center of gravity and poor ways of dealing with death wobble. OSHA defines powered industrial trucks (PITs) as any mobile power-propelled vehicle that is used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier materials, and that can be ridden or controlled by a walking operator (see Forklift Classification Explained,” below).</p>
