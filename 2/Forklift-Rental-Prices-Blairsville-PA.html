<p>31. 31 Training Program Content (continued)  The requirements of the OSHA standard on powered industrial trucks must also be included in the initial operator training program. Forklifts can unload pallets of bricks, construction materials and steel joists from the delivery truck and transport them to the job site. The frame, cab, boom, and body of a tele-scoping-boom rough terrain forklift are usually fabricated by the forklift manufacturer.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope. Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>
<p>We do extend special rates for longer term rentals. If your truck is lifted, or if you're getting ready to have a lift kit installed, make sure you're aware of all the potential safety and handling implications that are associated with the additional height and hardware.
